/** 
 * Class for a Union-Find data structure

 * Specifically, each array index stores that
 * vertex's parent. A `find` operatrion would now
 * need to traverse up to `n` parent pointers to
 * find the root. Conversely, the `union` method
 * is simpler but still needs x2 O(n) `find` operations.
 * Determining if two vertices are part of the same set
 * now also takes O(n) because of this change to `find`.
